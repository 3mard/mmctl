# mmctl

A remote CLI tool for
[Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server): the
Open Source, self-hosted Slack-alternative.

## Install

To install the project in your `$GOPATH`, simply run:

```
go get -u github.com/mgdelacroix/mmctl
```

## Compile

First we have to install the dependencies of the project. `mmctl` uses
[Go dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage the dependencies, so
after installing it, we need to run from the root of the project:

```sh
dep ensure
```

With the dependencies installed, we can compile the binary with:

```sh
go build -o bin/mmctl mmctl/main.go
```

## Usage

```sh
$ ./bin/mmctl
